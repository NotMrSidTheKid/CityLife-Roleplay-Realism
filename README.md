###### What is the game about you wonder? 
Yes, the game is **ultra realistic** almost everything is interative and game is more like ***GTA*** and we are still debating if we should add a npc system. You can steal parked cars and sell them  to make a store and  buy permits from the police station. We are trying to make many countys and many highways.
